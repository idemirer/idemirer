- **[STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 2 November](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-2-november)**

  The U.S. hotel industry reported positive year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 2 November.

  - Among the Top 25 Markets, Tampa saw the largest occupancy lift (+34.7% to 80.5%), due to continued displacement demand from Hurricane Milton.
  - New Orleans saw the highest increases in ADR (+27.7% to US$222.51) and RevPAR (+53.3% to US$169.73). The market’s performance was driven by Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour and the Annual ANCC Magnet and Pathway to Excellence Conference.
  - The steepest RevPAR declines were seen in Las Vegas (-28.8% to US$151.47) and San Francisco (-14.9% to US$123.16).

  - Occupancy: 60.8 (+1.9%)
  - Average daily rate (ADR): US$154.99 (+1.2%)
