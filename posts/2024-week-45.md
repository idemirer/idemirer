  The U.S. hotel industry reported positive year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 26 October.

  - Among the Top 25 Markets, Tampa saw the largest occupancy lift (+28.1% to 84.2%), due to continued displacement demand from Hurricane Milton.
  - New Orleans saw the highest increases in ADR (+64.1% to US$301.30) and RevPAR (+77.6% to US$227.24). The market’s performance was driven by Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour.
  - The steepest RevPAR declines were seen in Las Vegas (-7.9% to US$196.40) and Minneapolis (-6.5% to US$86.31).
