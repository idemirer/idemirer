- **[STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 21 December](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-21-december)**

  The U.S. hotel industry reported positive year-over-year performance comparisons, according to CoStarâ€™s latest data through 14 December.

  Growth was elevated due to the Hannukah calendar shift as well as the compressed business travel period between Thanksgiving and Christmas.

  - Among the Top 25 Markets, Tampa reported the largest year-over-year occupancy increase (+33.3% to 84.7%).
  - New York City posted the highest ADR lift (+30.1% to US$510.13).
  - Washington, D.C., registered the largest jump in RevPAR (+67.6% to US$151.18), while San Francisco saw the only decline in the metric (-16.4% to US$131.08). The American Geophysical Union annual meeting shifted from San Francisco in 2023 to Washington, D.C., in 2024, which impacted performance.

  15-21 Dec 2024 (percentage change from comparable weeks in 2023):

  - Occupancy: 48.90 (+11.4%)
  - Average daily rate (ADR): US$135.79 (+2.7%)
  - Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$66.36 (+14.3%)
