- **[CBRE raises outlook for 2023](https://hotelsmag.com/news/cbre-raises-hotel-outlook-for-2023/)**

  CBRE has raised its hotel performance forecast for 2023, following industry gains in Q4 2022 and the expectation of marginally positive GDP growth this year.

  - CBRE has revised its forecast for RevPAR to $97.46, up 5.8% YoY and an increase of $0.43 from its earlier forecast.
  - The revision is predicated on around 30 basis points increase in expected occupancy as against the November 2022 forecast.
  - The ADR forecast of $150.21 remained unchanged.

  CBRE’s baseline-scenario forecasts predicted a rise of 0.2% for full-year 2023 GDP growth and inflation of 4.7%. Considering the robust correlation between GDP and RevPAR growth, CBRE expected the revised economic outlook to impact the lodging industry results directly.
