- **[STR: U.S. hotel construction up year over year for first time since late 2020](https://str.com/press-release/str-us-hotel-construction-year-over-year-first-time-late-2020)**

  After 25 consecutive months of year-over-year declines, U.S. hotel construction increased slightly in December, according to pipeline data from STR.

  At a market-level, New York City, Phoenix and Dallas are set to see the largest supply percentage increases from current construction. Among the chain scales, the Luxury and Upscale segments lead in that measurement.

  Reflecting post-holiday seasonality and an unfavorable calendar shift, U.S. hotel performance fell from the previous week and showed weakened comparisons against 2019, according to STR‘s latest data through 7 January.

  - Orlando was the only Top 25 Market to report an occupancy increase over 2019 (+2.0% to 71.3%).
  - Of note, Las Vegas saw the highest occupancy level (73.5%). This was the first week with Las Vegas performance data included in STR’s reporting thanks to the rollout of new non-participant modeling in the U.S. Learn more here.
  - Oahu Island posted the highest ADR lift over 2019 (+42.6% to US$332.05).
  - San Francisco (-81.8% to US$72.25) saw the steepest RevPAR decline from 2019 due to the market hosting the College Football Playoff National Championship during the corresponding week in 2019.

  1-7 January 2023 (percentage change from comparable week in 2019):

  - Occupancy: 47.2% (-11.5%)
