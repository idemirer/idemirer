- **[Hotel Profit Margins Hover Close To 2019 Peaks](https://www.costar.com/article/191467173/hotel-profit-margins-hover-close-to-2019-peaks)**  
  Over the last couple of years, hotel profit-and-loss accounts have undergone quite a change in how they are analyzed. During a session at the Hotel Data Conference titled “Parsing the P&L: Analyzing Changes in Profit and Loss,” Audrey Kallman, operations analyst at STR, said revenues, costs and expenses have changed in order of importance across the pandemic months.  
  
  “Profitability peaked in 2019, but in that year all segments saw very limited [total revenue per available room],” Kallman said. “Over the past four years, labor costs have outpaced revenue growth, and as occupancy increases, you will see an additional rise in labor costs."  
  
  Kallman said the break-even percentage of occupancy decreased during the pandemic and continued falling as hoteliers further understood how to reduce expenses.
