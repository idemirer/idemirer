- **[Increased Menu Prices Deter Guests As Rapid Check Growth Continues](https://blog.blackboxintelligence.com/increased-menu-prices-deter-guests-despite-rapid-check-growth)**

  Sales growth was 2.7% in February, an improvement of 3.5 percentage points from January’s disappointing -0.8% growth and the 2.1% sales growth reported in December. Behind this decline in sales growth is a similar slowdown in guest counts. Traffic growth was -13.8% in February. Despite decline in traffic, sales growth improved over twice the rate of traffic in February, as average guest check growth accelerated again. Skyrocketing check growth remains a concern for traffic recovery, especially in light of rapidly rising prices throughout the economy, which continue to erode consumer purchasing power.
