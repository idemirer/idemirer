- **[AHLA: Proposed DOL overtime changes would harm hotels](https://www.hotelmanagement.net/operate/ahla-proposed-dol-overtime-changes-would-harm-hotels)**

  American Hotel & Lodging Association President & CEO Chip Rogers spoke out after the Department of Labor issued a proposal to increase the minimum salary threshold for employees to qualify as salaried executive, administrative and professional employees (and therefore exempt from overtime pay requirements) under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The proposal would bring the threshold to $55,068, up from the current $35,568—a nearly 55 percent increase.

  This would be the second increase in less than five years, and under the proposal, the threshold would automatically update every three years. Employees who fail to qualify for the FLSA’s “white collar” exemption must be paid overtime for any hours worked over 40 in a given workweek, which the association argues can limit managerial and worker development opportunities, such as remote work, travel, and career development.
