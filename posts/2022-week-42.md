  In a bid to solve the ongoing labor challenges facing U.S. businesses, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor are set to make an additional 64,716 H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker visas available for fiscal year 2023, on top of the 66,000 H-2B visas that are normally available each fiscal year.

- **[HVS Report - A Review of Equity Yields and Discount Rates in a Post-COVID Environment](https://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article123097.html)**  
  Equity yields and discount rates remain at or below pre-COVID levels; however, rising debt costs will result in changing investor return expectations.

  Equity yield is the rate of return that an equity investor expects over a holding period.

  The total property yields (discount rates) presented reflect the "free and clear" internal rate of return to an all-cash purchaser, or a blended rate of debt and equity return requirements.

  While weekday performance showed an expected decline due to Yom Kippur, school breaks and the extended holiday weekend helped lift levels on Friday and Saturday. Performance levels in Florida were also lifted by post-Hurricane Ian demand.

  - San Diego reported the largest ADR gain over 2019 (+39.3% to US$216.93).
  - San Francisco was the only market to post an ADR drop (-17.7% to US$227.56).
  - The steepest RevPAR declines were in San Francisco (-32.5% to US$162.40) and Minneapolis (-14.5% to US$84.46).
