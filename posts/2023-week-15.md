  The hotel industry ended 2022 in its most stable state since before the pandemic, and despite lingering uncertainty the sector is not pausing for a breath before resuming development. While U.S. hotel construction is up for the first time since the end of 2020, most of these projects consist of renovations and conversions of existing properties as a result of new brands arriving all over the U.S. via Marriott International, Hilton, Hyatt Hotels Corp., Wyndham Hotels & Resorts and Best Western Hotels & Resorts.
