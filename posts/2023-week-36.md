  U.S. Unemployment Rate Up to 3.8% for August.

  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 187,000 in August, and the unemployment rate rose to 3.8 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Employment continued to trend up in health care, leisure and hospitality, social assistance, and construction. Employment in transportation and warehousing declined.

  Employment in leisure and hospitality continued to trend up in August (+40,000). The industry had gained an average of 61,000 jobs per month over the prior 12 months. Employment in the industry remains below its pre-pandemic February 2020 level by 290,000, or 1.7 percent.

- **[AHLA: Proposed DOL overtime changes would harm hotels](https://www.hotelmanagement.net/operate/ahla-proposed-dol-overtime-changes-would-harm-hotels)**

  American Hotel & Lodging Association President & CEO Chip Rogers spoke out after the Department of Labor issued a proposal to increase the minimum salary threshold for employees to qualify as salaried executive, administrative and professional employees (and therefore exempt from overtime pay requirements) under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The proposal would bring the threshold to $55,068, up from the current $35,568—a nearly 55 percent increase.

  This would be the second increase in less than five years, and under the proposal, the threshold would automatically update every three years. Employees who fail to qualify for the FLSA’s “white collar” exemption must be paid overtime for any hours worked over 40 in a given workweek, which the association argues can limit managerial and worker development opportunities, such as remote work, travel, and career development.

  It is of utmost importance to make well-informed decisions based on data. You cannot make decisions based on assumptions or estimates alone. A small error in data can be a make-or-break point for your business. However, with the amount of unstructured data, it can be extremely difficult to know where to begin.
