- **[Deloitte: Holiday Season to Feature Fewer Shopping Bags and Suitcases as Consumers Navigate Inflation](https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4113106.html)**

  - Inflation will likely curb holiday shopping habits: Holiday spending is flat year-over-year with an average $1,455 per household, but consumers plan to purchase fewer gifts (nine gifts versus 16 gifts in 2021) for family and friends.
  - They will likely pull back on non-gift purchases (down 12% year-over-year), and shift spending to experiences (up 7% year-over-year).
  - Low-income earners plan to spend 25% more than last year, while high-income earners plan to cut back 7%.
  - Travel demand slows, with less than one-third (31%) of Americans planning to travel between Thanksgiving and mid-January, down from 42% in 2021.

- **[HVS Report - A Review of Equity Yields and Discount Rates in a Post-COVID Environment](https://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article123097.html)**  
  Equity yields and discount rates remain at or below pre-COVID levels; however, rising debt costs will result in changing investor return expectations.

  Equity yield is the rate of return that an equity investor expects over a holding period.

  The total property yields (discount rates) presented reflect the "free and clear" internal rate of return to an all-cash purchaser, or a blended rate of debt and equity return requirements.

- **[STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 15 October](https://str.com/press-release/str-us-hotel-results-week-ending-15-october)**  
  U.S. hotel performance increased from the previous week and produced mixed comparisons with 2019, according to STRâ€˜s latest data through 15 October.

  - Among the Top 25 Markets, Tampa reported the largest increases over 2019 in each of the key performance metrics: occupancy (+17.1% to 80.6%), ADR (+34.6% to US$159.80) and RevPAR (+57.7% to US$128.85). Tampa has been one of the markets in Florida that have seen a performance lifted associated with post-Hurricane Ian demand.

  - The steepest RevPAR declines were in San Francisco (-28.3% to US$170.49) and Minneapolis (-7.9% to US$80.19).
