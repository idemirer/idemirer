- **[Deloitte: Holiday Season to Feature Fewer Shopping Bags and Suitcases as Consumers Navigate Inflation](https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4113106.html)**

  - Inflation will likely curb holiday shopping habits: Holiday spending is flat year-over-year with an average $1,455 per household, but consumers plan to purchase fewer gifts (nine gifts versus 16 gifts in 2021) for family and friends.
  - They will likely pull back on non-gift purchases (down 12% year-over-year), and shift spending to experiences (up 7% year-over-year).
  - Low-income earners plan to spend 25% more than last year, while high-income earners plan to cut back 7%.
  - Travel demand slows, with less than one-third (31%) of Americans planning to travel between Thanksgiving and mid-January, down from 42% in 2021.
