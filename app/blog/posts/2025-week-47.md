## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 15 November](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-15-november)

The U.S. hotel industry reported negative year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 15 November.

- The Veteran’s Day calendar shift drove a double-digit decline in group demand, resulting in lower performance levels across the U.S.
- Among the Top 25 Markets, New Orleans reported the steepest declines across each of the three key performance metrics: occupancy (-23.9% to 59.4%), ADR (-9.6% to US$174.13) and RevPAR (-31.2% to US$103.42).
- Tampa registered the second-largest declines in occupancy (-19.7% to 70.0%) and RevPAR (-25.0% to US$115.66), due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Milton in 2024.

9-15 Nov 2025 (percentage change from comparable week in 2024):

- Occupancy: 60.90 (-4.1%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$154.41 (-0.5%)
- Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$93.97 (-4.6%)
