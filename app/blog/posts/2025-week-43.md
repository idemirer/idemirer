## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 11 October](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-11-october)

The U.S. hotel industry reported mixed year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 18 October.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, San Francisco reported the highest increases in each of the three key performance metrics: occupancy (+10.2% to 83.4%), ADR (+68.1% to US$368.79) and RevPAR (+85.3% to US$307.40). The market’s performance was lifted by Dreamforce 2025.
- Tampa recorded the largest occupancy drop (-23.2% to 63.5%), due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Milton in 2024.
- Miami saw the steepest declines in ADR (-27.2% to US$178.62) and RevPAR (-32.7% to US$120.96). The decreases were due to a comparison against Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour dates and Adobe MAX 2024.

5-11 Oct 2025 (percentage change from comparable week in 2024):

- Occupancy: 68.50 (-2.4%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$173.14 (+1.7%)
- Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$118.65 (-0.7%)
