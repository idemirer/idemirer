The U.S. hotel industry reported negative year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 6 September.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, Houston recorded the steepest declines in occupancy (-12.4% to 49.8%) and RevPAR (-18.7% to US$53.29). The decreases are largely due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Beryl in 2024.
- Houston (-7.1% to US$106.91) and Detroit matched for the largest decrease in ADR (-7.1% to US$119.90).
- St. Louis saw the highest lift in occupancy (+15.7% to 62.1%), while San Francisco reported the largest jumps in ADR (+10.4% to US$188.17) and RevPAR (+24.7% to US$128.70).
