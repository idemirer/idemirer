## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 30 August](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-30-august)

The U.S. hotel industry reported mostly positive year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 30 August.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, Houston recorded the steepest declines in occupancy (-12.0% to 56.3%) and RevPAR (-16.7% to US$63.48). The decreases are largely due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Beryl in 2024.
- Las Vegas reported the largest drop in ADR (-6.8% to US$184.28).
- St. Louis saw the highest lift in occupancy (+6.9% to 60.7%).

- Occupancy: 63.4 (-0.8%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$155.87 (+1.0%)
