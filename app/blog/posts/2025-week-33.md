## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 9 August](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-9-august)

The U.S. hotel industry reported negative year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 9 August.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, San Francisco reported the largest increases in each of the three key performance metrics: occupancy (+12.8% to 81.5%), ADR (+8.3% to US$210.29) and RevPAR (+22.2% to US$171.38). The market’s performance was helped by the World Transplant Congress.
- Houston recorded the steepest drop in occupancy (-27.5% to 55.3%) and RevPAR (-34.6% to US$61.38). The decreases are largely due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Beryl in 2024.

3-9 August 2025 (percentage change from comparable week in 2024):

- Occupancy: 68.0 (-1.0%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$159.61 (-0.6%)
- Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$108.47 (-1.6%)
