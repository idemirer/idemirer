## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 26 July](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-26-july)

The U.S. hotel industry reported negative year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 26 July.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, St. Louis reported the highest occupancy lift (+5.7% to 70.9%).
- Houston recorded the steepest declines in each of the three key performance metrics: occupancy (-19.7% to 61.1%), ADR (-7.7% to US$117.02) and RevPAR (-25.9% to US$71.54). The decreases are largely due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Beryl in 2024.

20-26 July 2025 (percentage change from comparable week in 2024):

- Occupancy: 71.50 (-0.7%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$164.88 (-0.1%)
- Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$117.88 (-0.8%)
