## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 1 June](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-1-june)

Due to Memorial Day, the U.S. hotel industry reported lower performance results from the previous week but slightly positive comparisons year over year, according to CoStarâ€™s latest data through 1 June.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, New Orleans saw the highest year-over-year occupancy lift (+17.8% to 66.8%).
- Las Vegas reported the largest increase in ADR (+7.4% to $177.13).
- Dallas reported the largest jump in RevPAR (+22.5% to US$86.07) and the second-highest increase in ADR (+6.9% to US$120.55). Severe storms in the market drove performance after many residents were left without power.
- The steepest RevPAR declines were seen in Washington, D.C. (-10.3% to US$105.24) and Denver (-7.6% to US$93.92).
