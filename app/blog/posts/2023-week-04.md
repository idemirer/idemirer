Despite persistent high inflation, an active Fed, and accelerating recessionary concerns, the lodging industry sustained the strong growth recorded in Q2 and Q3 of 2022 through the balance of the year. Transient demand continued to lead the recovery, surpassing 2019 levels in 19 of the past 21 months.
