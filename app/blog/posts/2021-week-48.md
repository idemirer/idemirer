- **[PwC: US Average daily rate expected to drive RevPAR next year to 93% of 2019 levels](https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4107694.html)**

  PwC: Given the strength of demand during the summer, we expect annual occupancy for US hotels this year to remain consistent with our May 2021 outlook, increasing to 57.1 percent. The bigger story is the significant lift in average daily room rates during the back half of Q2 and Q3; exceeding 2019 (pre-pandemic) levels in each month of Q3. We now expect average daily room rates to increase 19.6 percent for the year, with resultant RevPAR up 55.1 percent - - approximately 82 percent of pre-pandemic levels.
