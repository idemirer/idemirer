## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 5 October](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-5-october)

Due to Rosh Hashana, the U.S. hotel industry reported negative year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 5 October.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, Tampa saw the highest year-over-year increases in occupancy (+24.1% to 81.3%) and RevPAR (+22.1% to US$125.39). As is common around a natural disaster, the market’s hotel performance was lifted by displacement demand from Hurricane Helene.
- The steepest RevPAR declines were seen in Las Vegas (-25.9% to US$118.51) and Chicago (-25.8% to US$115.05).

29 Sep - 5 Oct 2024 (percentage change from comparable weeks in 2023):

- Occupancy: 65.6 (-3.4%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$156.25 (-4.4%)
- Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$102.44 (-7.7%)
