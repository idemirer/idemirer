The U.S. hotel industry reported negative year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 25 October.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, Tampa reported the steepest occupancy drop (-24.2% to 63.7%), due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Milton in 2024.
- New Orleans posted the largest decreases in ADR (-35.3% to US$195.39) and RevPAR (-41.9% to US$132.94). The market’s performance was affected by a comparison against Taylor Swift’s 2024 Eras Tour dates.
- Overall, 21 of the Top 25 Markets saw an occupancy decline.

19-25 Oct 2025 (percentage change from comparable week in 2024):

- Occupancy: 66.60 (-3.6%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$166.36 (-1.7%)
