## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 1 November](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-1-november)

The U.S. hotel industry reported mixed year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 1 November.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, Tampa reported the steepest occupancy drop (-24.6% to 60.5%), due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Milton in 2024.
- New Orleans posted the largest decreases in ADR (-23.9% to US$168.61) and RevPAR (-38.3% to US$104.29). The market’s performance was due to a comparison against the back half of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, as well as a midweek conference.
- San Francisco registered the highest increases across each of the three key performance metrics: occupancy (+13.8% to 71.5%), ADR (+17.0% to US$231.17) and RevPAR (+33.1% to US$165.31).

26 Oct - 1 Nov 2025 (percentage change from comparable week in 2024):

- Occupancy: 59.30 (-2.6%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$156.09 (+0.4%)
