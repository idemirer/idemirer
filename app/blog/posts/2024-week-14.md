### [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 30 March](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-30-march)

As expected ahead of the Easter holiday, U.S. hotel performance decreased from the previous week, according to CoStar’s latest data through 30 March.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, New York City reported the largest year-over-year increases in each of the three key performance metrics: occupancy (+13.2% to 88.2%), ADR (+14.1% to US$285.98) and RevPAR (+29.1% to US$252.18).
- The steepest RevPAR decline was seen in Houston (-22.3% to US$68.44) because of comparison to its NCAA Men’s Final Four host period last year.

24-30 March 2024 (percentage change from comparable weeks in 2023):

- Occupancy: 62.3 (-5.6%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$157.14 (-0.7%)
- Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$97.83 (-6.3%)
