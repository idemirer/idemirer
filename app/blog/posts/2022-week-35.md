Demand recovery for both the hotel and short-term home rental sectors appears to be happening quickly, but there's clear differences between the two. "Hotels, home rentals and how performance trends continue to evolve," AirDNA Director of Product Max Bernstein said as of June 2022, demand for short-term rentals is up 21% indexed to 2019, while hotel demand is down 3.4%.

June 2022 year-to-date data indexed to 2019 shows for every one home rental sold across all location and market types in 2019, nine hotel rooms were sold, whereas in 2022 the ratio dropped to seven rooms, Collazo said.
