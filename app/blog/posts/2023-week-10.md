## [Hospitality Sector Becomes America's Fastest-Growing Employer](https://www.pymnts.com/economy/2023/hospitality-sector-becomes-americas-fastest-growing-employer/)

At the outset of the COVID pandemic, America's hospitality sector undertook a swath of layoffs.

Now, the country's bars, restaurants and hotels are among the fastest-growing employers in the U.S., helping drive the lowest unemployment rate in decades.

That's according to a Sunday (Mar. 5) [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bars-hotels-and-restaurants-become-the-economys-fastest-growing-employers-47f5292f) by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which says the leisure-and-hospitality industry is rebuilding its workforce as the tech sector contracts.

And because these companies represent a larger number of jobs than the tech industry, it's led to a shift in hiring patterns that's kept the job market tight.
