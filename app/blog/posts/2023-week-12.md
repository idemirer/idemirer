## [Restaurant companies are feeling optimistic about labor](https://www.nrn.com/quick-service/restaurant-companies-are-feeling-optimistic-about-labor)

One labor software company reported a 22% increase in QSR candidate volume year-over-year, while several executives noted they’re at or near full staffing levels.

Who is applying for those jobs? In the quick-service segment, Harver measured a staggering 123.7% increase in candidate volume from those aged 30-plus in Q4 2022 versus Q4 2021. QSRs also received a 69.4% uptick in candidates 20-to-29 year-over-year. Contrarily, Harver’s data shows a 3% decrease in candidate volume for those aged 19 and under. Harver opines that widespread layoffs in other industries such as tech and retail could be driving the applicant flow into restaurants.
