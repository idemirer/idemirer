The U.S. hotel industry reported positive year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 19 October.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, Tampa saw the largest occupancy lift (+23.6% to 83.7%), due to continued displacement demand from Hurricane Milton.
- Miami saw the highest increases in ADR (+29.9% to US$245.28) and RevPAR (+35.5% to US$179.72). The market’s performance was driven by Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour and Adobe MAX 2024.
