The U.S. hotel industry reported negative year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 15 March.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, San Francisco saw the highest occupancy lift (+6.6% to 63.7%).
- Houston reported the largest increases in ADR (+13.8% to US$137.98) and RevPAR (+16.0% to US$97.21).
- The steepest RevPAR declines were seen in Anaheim (-27.8% to US$149.51) and Seattle (-15.5% to US$101.77), the latter due to a calendar shift of the Aerospace & Defense Suppliers Summit.
