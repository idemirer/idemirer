U.S. hotel performance increased from the previous week, while year-over-year comparisons were skewed downward due to a calendar shift, according to CoStar’s latest data through 30 December.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, Miami saw the largest year-over-year increase in occupancy (+3.9% to 79.6%). The market’s performance was helped by the Capital One Orange Bowl and New Year’s Eve weekend.
- Anaheim posted the highest gains in ADR (+11.9% to US$219.71) and RevPAR (+12.5% to US$160.25).
- The steepest RevPAR declines were seen in Las Vegas (-28.3% to US$112.79) and Nashville (-27.0% to US$80.19).
