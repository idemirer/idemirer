## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 2 August](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-2-august)

The U.S. hotel industry reported mostly positive year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 2 August.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, San Francisco reported the largest increases in each of the three key performance metrics: occupancy (+15.5% to 81.7%), ADR (+15.4% to US$218.91) and RevPAR (+33.2% to US$178.74). The market’s performance was helped by the start of the World Transplant Congress.
- Houston recorded the steepest drop in occupancy (-19.3% to 61.2%) and RevPAR (-25.3% to US$69.99). The decreases are largely due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Beryl in 2024.

27 July - 2 August 2025 (percentage change from comparable week in 2024):

- Occupancy: 69.50 (-0.1%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$161.00 (+0.5%)
- Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$111.90 (+0.4%)
