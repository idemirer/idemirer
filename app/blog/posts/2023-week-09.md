### [AHLA: Hotels continue to recover in 2023](https://hotelbusiness.com/ahla-hotels-continue-to-recover-in-2023/)

The hotel industry in 2023 is projected to surpass pre-pandemic levels of demand, nominal room revenue and state and local tax revenue, while inching closer to other key 2019 performance metrics, according to the [American Hotel & Lodging Association’s 2023 State of the Hotel Industry Report](https://www.ahla.com/sites/default/files/AHLA.SOTI_.Report.2023.final_.002.pdf).

_The top findings of the report:_

- 2023 nominal room revenue is projected to reach new heights ($197.48 billion vs. $170.35 billion in 2019). While these numbers are not adjusted for inflation, and real revenue recovery will likely take several more years, the trendlines are positive.
- 2023 room-night demand is projected to surpass pre-pandemic levels (1.3 billion occupied room nights vs. 1.29 billion in 2019).
- Hotels are expected to generate $46.71 billion in state and local tax revenue in 2023, up from $41.11 billion in 2019.
