## [Major markets will lead growth in 2025](https://www.hotelmanagement.net/data-trends/marcus-millichap-releases-midyear-2024-fort-lauderdale-report)

After a growth streak between 2021 and 2023, lodging performance in 2024 has been disappointing. Robert Mandelbaum, from CBRE Hotels, has the following forecast for 2025:

- **RevPAR Growth**: Major U.S. markets are forecast to achieve a 3.3% increase in revenue per available room (RevPAR), with the 25 largest markets seeing a slightly higher increase of 3.5%.
- **Supply and Demand**: Supply growth in major markets is expected to be 1.4%, while demand for hotel rooms in these cities is projected to increase by 2.3%, resulting in a 0.9% occupancy growth.
- **Pricing Power**: Major markets are projected to see a 2.4% increase in average daily rates (ADR), giving hotel operators some pricing power.
- **Upper-Priced Properties**: These are expected to achieve the greatest RevPAR gains, with a forecasted 3.6% increase.
- **Development Hotspots**: Savannah, GA, is expected to see the greatest increase in lodging inventory (4.1%), followed by New York City (4.0%). Other development hotspots include Fort Worth, Nashville, and Phoenix.
- **Challenges**: Some markets like Albany, San Francisco, and Pittsburgh are expected to see a decline in room inventory due to closures.
- **Overall**, while the growth rates are below long-run averages, major markets are expected to perform better than rural areas.
