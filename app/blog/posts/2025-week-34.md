## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 16 August](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-16-august)

The U.S. hotel industry reported mostly negative year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 16 August.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, Seattle saw the highest increases in occupancy (+7.5% to 83.9%) and RevPAR (+10.9% to US$178.62).
- Houston recorded the steepest drop in occupancy (-24.0% to 57.2%) and RevPAR (-27.1% to US$66.84). The decreases are largely due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Beryl in 2024.
- New Orleans reported the second-largest declines in occupancy (-13.7% to 45.0%) and RevPAR (-17.2% to US$53.82).

10-16 August 2025 (percentage change from comparable week in 2024):

- Occupancy: 66.3 (-0.9%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$157.51 (+0.4%)
