## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 16 August](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-23-august)

The U.S. hotel industry reported negative year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 23 August.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, Houston recorded the steepest declines in occupancy (-29.3% to 53.7%) and RevPAR (-38.1% to US$58.43). The decreases are largely due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Beryl in 2024.
- Chicago reported the largest drop in ADR (-22.3% to US$167.40) and the second-steepest decrease in RevPAR (-19.9% to US$125.14), due to a comparison against the Democratic National Convention in 2024.

17-23 August 2025 (percentage change from comparable week in 2024):

- Occupancy: 65.4 (-1.1%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$155.09 (-0.2%)
- Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$101.38 (-1.3%)
