Due to a comparison against election week in 2024, the U.S. hotel industry reported positive year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 8 November.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, San Francisco (+43.0% to US$157.43) and Washington, D.C. (+43.0% to US$138.52) matched for the largest increase in RevPAR.
- San Francisco also reported the highest occupancy lift (+23.1% to 71.6%), while Washington, D.C. posted the largest jump in ADR (+21.9% to US$195.73).
- Tampa registered the largest declines in occupancy (-20.6% to 67.2%) and RevPAR (-24.1% to US$109.67), due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Milton in 2024.

- Occupancy: 64.20 (+2.5%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$162.70 (+3.6%)
