## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 19 July](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-19-july)

The U.S. hotel industry reported negative year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStar’s latest data through 19 July.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, San Francisco reported the highest occupancy lift (+7.8% to 77.2%).
- Houston recorded the steepest declines in each of the three key performance metrics: occupancy (-27.6% to 59.6%), ADR (-14.7% to US$115.94) and RevPAR (-38.3% to US$69.07). The decreases are largely due to the elevated displacement demand period that followed Hurricane Beryl in 2024.
- Las Vegas registered the second-largest drops in occupancy (-11.9% to 74.3%) and RevPAR (-17.1% to US$142.62).

13-19 July 2025 (percentage change from comparable week in 2024):

- Occupancy: 71.60 (-2.6%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$165.49 (-0.7%)
- Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$118.54 (-3.3%)
