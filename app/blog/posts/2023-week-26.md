## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 24 June](https://str.com/press-release/str-us-hotel-results-week-ending-24-june)

U.S. hotel performance remained mostly flat from the previous week, and year-over-year comparisons remained mixed, according to STR‘s latest data through 24 June.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, Minneapolis saw the highest year-over-year increases in each of the three key performance metrics: occupancy (+9.1% to 74.5%), ADR (+20.2% to US$158.08) and RevPAR (+31.1% to US$117.80). The substantial increases were driven by Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour.
- The steepest RevPAR declines were seen in New Orleans (-14.6% to US$87.85) and Miami (-11.9% to US$122.22).

18-24 June 2023 (percentage change from comparable weeks in 2022, 2019):
