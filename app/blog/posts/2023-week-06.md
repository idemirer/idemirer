The first jobs report of 2023 overshot expectations. Overall, the economy added a staggering 517,000 jobs in January—far higher than the 187,000 increase that was expected—and the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, its lowest since 1969.

Leisure and Hospitality (L&H) added 128,000 jobs in January, more than any other sector.
