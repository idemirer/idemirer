## [STR: U.S. hotel results for week ending 18 January](https://str.com/press-release/us-hotel-results-week-ending-18-january)

The U.S. hotel industry reported negative year-over-year comparisons, according to CoStarâ€™s latest data through 11 January.

Performance was impacted by shifts in the MLK Day and group/conference calendars, as well as various weather events, including the Los Angeles fires and winter storm Cora.

- Among the Top 25 Markets, Tampa reported the largest gains in each of the three key performance metrics: occupancy (+18.2% to 79.1%), ADR (+7.6% to US$178.42), and RevPAR (+27.2% to US$141.20).
- Of note, Los Angeles saw the second-highest increases in occupancy (+5.7% to 65.0%) and RevPAR (+8.6% to US$122.63), due to displacement demand from the fires.
- The steepest RevPAR decline was reported in San Francisco (-78.1% to US$85.89), due to the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference calendar shift.

12-18 Jan 2025 (percentage change from comparable week in 2024):

- Occupancy: 55.80 (+6.7%)
- Average daily rate (ADR): US$155.81 (+10.0%)
- Revenue per available room (RevPAR): US$86.93 (+17.4%)
